I'm a cloud infrastructure engineer and have been managing various IT infrastructures for over 12 years, including numerous classified DOD and DOE networks. I've recently migrated to the private sector - managing the cloud and on-prem infrastructure of an incredible nonprofit dedicated to ending killing in America's animal shelters. When not banging my head against a wall trying to fix DNS you will most likely find me hunkered down at home with my wife, three doggos and kitty, playing guitar or having an existential crisis.
